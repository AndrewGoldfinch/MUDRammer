1.8.7

+ Bluetooth keyboard commands for switching sessions! Control+` (back-tick) will switch to the next World. Control+1,2,3, or 4 will switch to that World.
+ Bluetooth keyboard movement commands have been tweaked for better compatibility with VoiceOver. The new keys are: Command+←→↑↓ for W/E/N/S, and Command+Control+←→↑↓ for SW/NE/NW/SE.
+ Restored the Bluetooth Keyboard preference and removed some faulty auto-detection logic. When you have an external Bluetooth connected, enable Settings → Advanced → Bluetooth Keyboard.
+ Session logs are now saved as plain text files, both for emailing within MUDRammer as well as downloading via iTunes.
+ Worlds should no longer be marked as unread if the only change is a line that was suppressed by one of your Gags.
+ Fixed an issue when attempting to copy a blank line of text.
+ Fixed another crash related to processing cursor-position commands.

1.8.6

+ Fixed a crash related to processing screen-clear commands. MUDRammer is deeply embarrassed and shrinks into its shell, forfeiting two full levels of experience.
+ VoiceOver should now only speak text related to the currently visible world.

Previously in MUDRammer 1.8.5:

MUDRammer has discovered an ancient tome of arcane knowledge!

New abilities unlocked:
+ Tap a row of text to quickly add a new Trigger or Gag for that text!
+ Set a custom command separator for multiple commands in your Triggers, Tickers, and text inputs. No longer semicolons only!
+ MUDRammer will now process text and run triggers and gags for all connected Worlds, not only the visible World.
+ 12 new Trigger and Ticker sounds from the Mirani sound pack!
+ Handoff support! iOS 8 users can start browsing a web page in MUDRammer and continue browsing on another device on the same iCloud account.
+ Added asterisk (*) to the character bar. Enable it in Settings → Advanced → Character Bar.

Plus:
+ Restored the missing Copy action when tapping on a row of text. 
+ Aliases and Gags on the World editor list are now sorted alphabetically (previously by last modified date).
+ Improved file names for session logs to include the World's hostname and a human-readable date (e.g. "nanvaent.org - 3-15-15, 12:00pm")
+ Simple Telnet Mode will now also ignore cursor positioning, line clear, and screen clear commands. 
+ Increased the delay for World connect commands from 3 to 5 seconds.
+ Switched NE/SE/NW/SW Bluetooth keyboard commands from CONTROL+OPTION+←→↑↓ to CONTROL+COMMAND+←→↑↓ for better compatibility with VoiceOver.
+ Squashed some extra blank lines that appeared when 'Echo Typing' is disabled.

1.8.4

MUDRammer has leveled up its STRENGTH, DEXTERITY, and INTELLIGENCE.

STRENGTH:
+ MUDRammer has a powerful and fast new ANSI parser with new support for cursor positioning. Newly supported CSI codes include: cursor up, cursor down, cursor forward, cursor back, cursor next line, cursor previous line, cursor horizontal absolute, cursor position, erase display, and erase in line.

DEXTERITY:
+ New connect commands! Save one or more commands with your World that will be sent 3 seconds after connecting.
+ 4 new sounds for your Triggers and Tickers!

INTELLIGENCE:
+ Bluetooth Keyboard movement keys! If you have a Bluetooth keyboard connected, you may use CONTROL+←→↑↓ to move w/e/n/s and CONTROL+OPTION+←→↑↓ to move sw/ne/nw/se.
+ MUDRammer is smarter about detecting whether you've connected a Bluetooth keyboard. Accordingly, the Bluetooth Keyboard setting in Advanced Preferences has been removed.
+ MUDRammer is more forgiving about detecting taps on URLs and links. If you're still having trouble tapping on links, try increasing your font size in Settings → Themes.
+ Accessibility: as you scroll up and down, MUDRammer will now announce your page offset (e.g. Page 2 of 4).
+ Accessibility: scrolling up will focus VoiceOver on the last row of the new page. Scrolling down will focus VoiceOver on the first row of the new page.
+ Accessibility: MUDRammer should be smarter about VoiceOver timeouts and not skipping text.
